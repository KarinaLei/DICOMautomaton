IWYU is now supported natively by CMake, so it is less tedious to invoke as part of the build process.

Instructions (Debian):

0. Install the 'clang' and 'include-what-you-use' packages.

1. Ensure the include-what-you-use binary is called 'iwyu' and is in $PATH.

2. Compile like

   $>  CC="clang" CXX="clang++" ./compile_and_install.sh -c 2>/tmp/iwyu.txt


The file /tmp/iwyu.txt contains the report. Significant post-processing is likely required. Compiler warnings and errors
may need to be filtered out. Due to lots of private / implementation headers being suggested, gratuitous disordering of
the includes, and disregard for ifdef includes, it seems best to manually implement the suggested fixes. Simply removing
all the suggested removals won't work because the removals include replacements (which sometimes recommend
implementation headers). Keeping an up-to-date mapping file (as described in the previous IWYU how-to) does not seem
reasonable.

A script that implements a subset of the recommendations is provided.
